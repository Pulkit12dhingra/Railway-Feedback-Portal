# Railway Feedback Portal

First of all in order to run the code you should create a twilio account:-https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio. Signup or login and add account ID and authenticatiion token in the code( msg function ) (ps mine is not working). 

We all have visited railways, traveled in trains. Feedback is really an important aspect of improvement. In the case of the railway network, we have millions of passengers traveling each day. Getting feedback from all is not possible. Thus we have a railway feedback application system, developed using Tkinter GUI-based interactive interphase. It allows the passengers to rate their journey and give valuable feedback.
This project deals with build-in a railway feedback portal where if you are an admin you may look at reviews by customers and if you are a customer i.e... you have traveled on superb Indian railways then you may submit your valuable reviews.

Admins can access all reviews and delete them if required.

Libraries used are:-

Tkinter:-(Documentation:-https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html )
Sqlite3:-(Documentation:-https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html )
Twilio (Documentation:-https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python )
Pillow:-(Documentation:-https://pillow.readthedocs.io/ )
Requests:-(Documentation:-https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
Json (Documentation:-https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html )

Well there is not too much to talk about in this project.

I used MySQL database but you may use the database of your choice. It's just the accurate one for the cause

Play with the code to know more about it.

Hey!!

I learned a lot from this project, I hope it will teach you the same.....

# Enjoyyy.............!!! :)
